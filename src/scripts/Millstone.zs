// recipe for fishcakes
// FIX NEEDED: as the recipe is now the recipe requires exactly 2 fish, otherwise it makes Ground Meat from BWA, so I'm trying to find a way to fix this while also showing correctly in JEI
// maybe we could remove the recipe that uses fish for Ground meat, since you most likely won't be using fish for Meatballs and Meat pie anyway. If you still feel like we should keep the recipe we could use the command "setPriority(int priority)" to assign it lower priority, which should fix the issue, as seen bellow)

// I also wanted to make it so you need at least 3 bonito before making this recipe as the default recipe requires 4 with an output of 32, and it just felt right to me
